- A stubbed-out footer component.
- The initial files for a hero carousel have been created.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was scaffolding the  component. It created the  and  files and added the component to the  file, placing it between the Header and the navigation tabs.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Add-to-Cart Functionality is Broken (P0 - CRITICAL BLOCKER)

Issues Detail:
- Issue 1:
  - Description: The testing agent reported that the add-to-cart functionality is broken. Users cannot add items to their cart, which blocks the entire purchase flow (cart, checkout, thank you page). The agent acknowledged this but was redirected by the user to other tasks before fixing it.
  - Attempted fixes: None. The issue was identified and then immediately deprioritized in favor of new user requests.
  - Next debug checklist:
    1.  Review  and the  function.
    2.  Check the  file to ensure the  request is correctly formatted.
    3.  Examine  to see how the cart state is being updated after the API call.
    4.  Inspect browser console logs and network tab for errors when the Add to Cart button is clicked.
  - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a critical blocker. Fixing it will restore the core purchasing functionality of the application.
  - Status: NOT STARTED
  - Is recurring issue? N
  - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both (Frontend testing agent to verify the entire user journey).
  - Blocked on other issue: None. This is the primary blocker.

**In progress Task List**:
- Task 1: Complete Hero Carousel Implementation (P1)
  - Where to resume: The component files (, ) and its placement in  exist. The next steps are to implement the slider/carousel logic (e.g., using a library like  or a custom hook), populate it with static or dynamic image data, and apply the necessary styling.
  - What will be achieved with this? A visually engaging carousel will be present on the homepage, as requested by the user.
  - Status: IN PROGRESS
  - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend (screenshot tool)
  - Blocked on something: None

- Task 2: Integrate Footer Component (P2)
  - Where to resume: The  and  files have been created. The component needs to be imported and rendered in the main  layout so it appears on all pages.
  - What will be achieved with this? The application will have a consistent footer with policy links and company info.
  - Status: NOT STARTED
  - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend (screenshot tool)
  - Blocked on something: None

    - Competition Management (CRUD).
    - Theme Customization Interface.
    - User and Order Management.

    - Support Ticket Interface.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The CSS files, particularly  and , have undergone multiple, rapid iterations to adjust UI elements. A review to consolidate and clean up redundant or overridden styles would improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
- : The response of this endpoint was modified to include detailed instant win information for the frontend to render.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
Your first and highest priority is to **fix the broken add to cart functionality**. This is a P0, critical blocker that was identified by the testing agent but not resolved. Do not proceed with any new feature requests until users can successfully add items to their cart. Once fixed, you can proceed with completing the Hero Carousel implementation.
